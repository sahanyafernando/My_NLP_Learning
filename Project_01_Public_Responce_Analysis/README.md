# 🌍 NLP Project: Multilingual Public Response Analysis
## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing multilingual public responses to government policies 
and events using Natural Language Processing (NLP). Governments often introduce reforms 
or respond to crises, which trigger large-scale discussions across platforms such as
Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit. These conversations—especially when expressed in multiple
languages—are critical for understanding public sentiment, support trends, concerns, 
and potential misinformation across time and regions.

This project simulates such real-world scenarios using a multilingual social media 
dataset and applies both classical and advanced NLP techniques to extract insights.

## 🎯 Main Objective
To develop an end-to-end multilingual NLP pipeline capable of:
  - Cleaning and preprocessing noisy social media text
  - Extracting linguistic and semantic features
  - Performing sentiment analysis and topic modeling
  - Tracking temporal and event-based sentiment shifts
  - Summarizing large volumes of public discourse
