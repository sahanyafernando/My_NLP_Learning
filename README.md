# 📘 NLP Learning & Projects Repository
## Overview

This repository contains my Natural Language Processing (NLP) learning work, experiments, and small projects, developed while building a strong foundation in both classical and modern NLP techniques.

It serves two purposes:

 1. 📚 Learning & demonstrations of NLP concepts

 2. 🚀 Structured projects applying NLP to real-world scenarios

Each major subfolder will have its own detailed README explaining methods, models, and results.

🔹 Project_1_Public_Responce_Analysis

📌 Project Summary

  Public Response Analysis is an end-to-end NLP project focused on analyzing multilingual public sentiment and thematic trends around government policies and events using simulated social media data.

🔹 Key Aspects

  - Multilingual text processing (English, Spanish, French, German, Hindi)
  - Sentiment analysis using:
    + Rule-based methods
    + Classical ML models
    + Transformer-based approaches
  - Topic modeling and clustering
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER) and aspect-based sentiment analysis
  - Temporal and event-based sentiment tracking
  - Extractive and abstractive text summarization

This project demonstrates how NLP can be used to understand public opinion at scale across platforms, regions, and languages.

📂 Detailed implementation, models, and results are documented inside the project’s subfolder.

### Technologies & Tools

  - Python
  - NLTK, spaCy
  - Scikit-learn
